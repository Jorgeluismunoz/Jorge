I am Jorge Munoz, I currently enrolled  an AAS Computer and Software Development; this is my fifth quarter. In my native country (Venezuela) I worked in the telecommunications area. Motivated by the political, social and economic situation, I had to emigrate and I am currently learning software development. I have all the availability to learn and venture into this field, I would like to improve my skills as a programmer and learn more about development of applications, websites or video games. 

In the last team where I developed my work as a project engineer, I was able to increase the performance and efficiency of the project implementation group.

I have a great capacity for self-learning, this allows me to achieve better productivity rates for the company, in relation to the management of work teams.

I have experience with teamwork and I have empathy for problem solving. I consider that a company is like a big family, and I try to ensure that the professional climate is the best possible in terms of treatment and improvements for each one of us.

When I do a job, I do it for satisfaction, which allows me to be a competent person and I always do my best. I have a high sense of commitment and responsibility so I can guarantee that the task assigned to me will be handled diligently. However, when difficulties occasionally arise that may hinder the development of the activity, I propose useful solutions and alternatives to speed up response times.
